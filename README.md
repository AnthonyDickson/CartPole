# CartPole - Q-Learning with OpenAI Gym
## About
In this repo I will try to implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent using the [Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)  algorithm. 

## Environment
The code is written and tested in the following environment:
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.7.0 
- Conda 4.5.11
- OpenAI Gym 0.10.9

## Setup
1. Make sure you have a similar environment as above. OS doesn't matter unless you are running windows (OpenAI Gym doesn't support Windows). You can find information for installing Conda [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) and OpenAI Gym [here](https://gym.openai.com/).
2. Clone this repo to your computer:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://www.github.com/eight0153/CartPole.git
   ```
3. Cd into the repo directory:
    ```bash
    $ cd CartPole
    ```
4. Run the code:
    ```bash
    $ python main.py
    ```
5. Done!
